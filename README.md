# 🚀 Meme Generator

## ℹ️ About this project

This is a project that is a part of [Scrimba's React Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) by Bob Ziroll.

This is part of a module, where we have to build a project while learning ReactJS.

This is the first dynamic website created on the course, with challenges to build the app while learning the concepts and a [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/MoLwFPHNHJVrzdFurxHzNV/Meme-Generator) to replicate.

The main goal of the project was to learn practise `Event Listeners`, `useState()`, `Conditional Rendering`, `Forms` and `useEffect`.
